Add an [octopon.me](https://octopon.me/) active coupon gallery to your Wordpress site or blog - a great way to allow your potential clients to sign up for your coupons. 

== Description ==
The octopon Wordpress plugin allows you to add a frame (iframe) to your Wordpress blog/website, that will show your active coupons created via [octopon.me](https://octopon.me/). This is not an eCommerce system, rather a way to allow your potential clients to sign up for your coupons. We will soon have full integration with Woo Commerce.
 
**Features**:
* Shows your active octopon.me coupons rotating with fade animation
* If you have no active coupons, shows a “sign up” form for potential clients, allowing them to follow your business and receive coupons to their email when you have an active one
